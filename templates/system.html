        This graph shows the severity of incidents over time for the selected category, where severity is calculated as a combination of incident grade and category risk level.
        <br>
        The higher the severity, the more malicious the attack.
        {% elif data_request == "grade" %}
        This graph illustrates the grade distribution over time, where grades represent the likelihood of an incident being malicious (e.g., TruePositive, BenignPositive, FalsePositive).
        <br>
        The higher the grade, the more accurate the security system was in determining this type of incident was an active threat.
