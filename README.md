# AI Security Risk Detector ⚠️
An AI-driven tool to identify potential security vulnerabilities in software repositories by analyzing code patterns, comments, and dependency usage. The goal is to provide developers with an early warning system for high-risk code, making it easier to remediate issues before they become critical.

## Overview
Security vulnerabilities can arise from outdated libraries, unvalidated user input, poor cryptographic practices, or even simple oversights in logic. The **AI Security Risk Detector** uses NLP (Natural Language Processing) models and static code analysis to detect these red flags automatically. By scanning repository files, the tool provides prompt insights and advice to developers, allowing them to address issues quickly and confidently.

## Features
- **Pattern-Based Analysis**: Searches for known security anti-patterns (e.g., hardcoded credentials, insecure hashing).
- **NLP-Enhanced Detection**: Analyzes code comments and commit messages for suspicious or deprecated language.
- **Dependency Checker**: Evaluates library versions and highlights those with known vulnerabilities.
- **Scalable**: Designed to handle large repositories and continuous integration scenarios.
- **Multi-Language Support**: Works with popular programming languages (e.g., Python, JavaScript, Java, C++), with more planned.

## How It Works
1. **Project Scan**: The AI Security Risk Detector crawls the codebase to collect .py, .js, .java, and other source files.
2. **Tokenization & Analysis**: The tool tokenizes the code and uses machine learning models trained on common security vulnerabilities to flag high-risk sections.
3. **Dependency Audit**: Checks `package.json`, `requirements.txt`, and other dependency files against a vulnerability database.
4. **Report Generation**: Summarizes all detected issues in a structured report, complete with severity levels and suggested mitigation strategies.

## Installation
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DMahjoob/SecurityRiskDetector.git
   cd SecurityRiskDetector
